* high level: developer does not have to worry about managing 
resources.
* garbage-collected: automatically removes old, unused objects
from the computer memory.
* interpreted or just-in-time compiled:
* prototyped-based object-oriented: almost everything in js is an 
object. 
* first-class functions: functions are simply treated as variables.
We can pass them into other functions and return them from functions.
* dynamic: dynamically-typed language, which means no data type 
definitions.
* single-threaded: 
    - concurrency model: how the js engine handles multiple tasks
    hapenning at the same time?
        R: java script runs in one single thread, so it can only 
        do one thing at a time.

THE JAVASCRIPT ENGINE AND RUNTIME
JS ENGINE
- Its a program that executes js code. Every browser has its own js engine.
- Every js engine contains:
    1) call stack: is where our code is actually executed.
    2) heap: where stores all the objects that our application needs.

COMPILATIONS VS. INTERPRETATION
- Every single computer program needs to be converted into machine code (zeros and ones),
and this can happen using compilation or interpretation.
- In compilation, the entire source code is converted into machine code at once.
And this machine code is then written into a portable file that can be executed on 
any computer.
-  In interpretation, there is an interpreter which runs through the source code, 
and executes it line by line. implementations execute instructions directly and freely, 
without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. They are
read and executed by some other program. (MUCH SLOWER)
- Modern JS uses Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation: entire code is converted into 
machine code at onde, then executed immediately. During execution the program may 
be compiled into native code to improve its performance. 

JS RUNTIME
It's a big box which inludes all the things that we need to use 
JavaScript. Runtine is composed by the js engine and web API's.
